# SoCiaL-NeTWoRK-aPi

This is a back-nd project that used Mongoose for the main build.  This is the main component for the social media application and the project also uses Node.js, express and Javascript to work with HTTP requests and responses.  
The program creates, deletes, updates and views users as well as thoughts it also adds and deletes friends while showing how many friends a user has.  It will also allow the user to comment and delete comments on thoughts in the system.
